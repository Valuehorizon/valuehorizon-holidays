Valuehorizon Holidays 0.3.1 documentation!
==============================================

The foreign exchange market (holidays, FX, or currency market) is a global decentralized market for the trading of currencies. In terms of volume of trading, it is by far the largest market in the world. This reusable Django app provides you with the tools to keep track of a set of currencies and their price data.

Valuehorizon Holidays includes two models - ``Currency`` and ``CurrencyPrice``. All ``Currency`` data are provided and maintained. Some sample ``CurrencyPrice``
data are provided, but for a full production dataset, you will have to source this data yourself.
